The web services access method requires an employer to develop software that interfaces with E-Verify to create and manage cases. The employerâ€™s software should extract data from its existing system or an electronic Form I-9 and transmit the information to E-Verify. Employers who choose this option receive a web services Interface Control Agreement (ICA) which contains the information used to develop and test the software interface. Both employers and E Verify employer agents can use this access method.
